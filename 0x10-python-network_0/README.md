## Project Description

This project focuses on understanding HTTP, cURL, and network-related concepts. Each task involves writing Bash and Python scripts to perform specific actions, such as sending HTTP requests, handling status codes, and working with JSON data.

## Tasks

### Task 0: cURL body size

Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response in bytes.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script for displaying the size of the response body in bytes
# Usage: ./0-body_size.sh <URL>

# Your explanation goes here...
```

...

### Task 1: cURL to the end

Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response for a 200 status code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script for displaying the body of the response for a 200 status code
# Usage: ./1-body.sh <URL>

# Your explanation goes here...
```
